  description: 'When The Boss first drops below a percentage of his Health, he leaves
    combat to start doing sit-ups. Each sit-up restores a percentage of his maximum
    Health and gives him Attack and Movement Speed. If he reaches full Health he
    returns to combat Pumped Up: all of his attacks and spells deal true damage.
    If all of his allies die, he will immediately return to combat.'
